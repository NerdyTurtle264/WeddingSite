    <p><i>After the technological disaster, the recording was done on the fly, so please pardon any transitions or roughness. Not shown in the video are the two fawns who dropped by to observe the gathering just thirty feet behind Alison! They stuck around most of the weekend and often found their way into the photos. A transcription of the ceremony has been provided by Sara Tetley, the friend asked to officiate.</i>

    <p>Sara's Introduction</p>
    <p><i>I’d like to welcome the family, the friends, and most importantly, the Couple: Alison and Johnny. Each and every one of us is honored to be here or at home, celebrating this incredibly joyous occasion, witnessing the next evolution in their lives together. As Alison and Johnny take their relationship to the next level, this gathering is a testament to their love and solidarity.</i></p>
    <p><i>Alison and Johnny have already been committed in their hearts since they met, but today they are proclaiming that commitment not only to us, the people closest to them, but to the world and the government as well. They are declaring, “we love each other, we support each other, and we want to have a better tax break.”</i></p>
    <p><i>Shortly after beginning their relationship, the couple parted for the summer. Alison suggested they read each other’s favorite book over the break and handed Johnny a carefully selected volume she had read a dozen times. Johnny produced a 1,000 page brick. Ali carried this monstrosity with her every day that summer, fighting through the dense text on every bus ride and lunch break. Eventually she realized it was not one book, but a collection of five. In retaliation for his trickery, when they went back to college, she produced his other four assignments.That book, The Cleric’s Quintet became a favorite story for them and now has been used to make the decoration around us and the flowers that they both bear. We thought it an apt metaphor. Johnny trolled her, and Alison fought back. Now they are tied together by it.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is now time for you two to reveal your personal oaths to each other, and what is in your hearts before you repeat your vows.</i></p>
    <p>Alison’s Vows</p>
    <p><i>On April 18th, 2015, I realized that the idea of spending any of my life not with you was absolutely abhorrent and I asked you to marry me on the spot. Never in all my days since then, have I regretted that spur of the moment proposal.</i></p>
    <p><i>Here now, in front of the people who love us most, I make many promises to you, starting with the small ones: I vow to eat the first and last slices of the bread loaf, so you don’t have to. I will sing along to every one of your improvised songs. I will listen to you whenever you discuss computer stuff that I do not understand. Now for the big ones: I will love you with everything I am. When you feel weak, I will hold you. When you are sick, I will care for you. I will celebrate your joys and mourn your sorrows as my own. I will stand at your back so that the world may never overtake us. I will be the first person you talk to in the morning and the last one every night. I pledge my person and my future to entwine with yours, and I have never been happier.</i></p>
    <p>Johnny's Vows</p>
    <p><i>Your love gives me hope. Your smile gives me joy. You make me a better man. You know me better than anyone else in this world and you are my best friend and one true love. I promise to love and care for you, and I will try in every way to be worthy of your love. I will always be honest with you, kind, and patient. But most of all, I promise to be a true and loyal friend to you. There is still a part of me today that cannot believe that I’m the one who gets to marry you. I'm so lucky that I get to call you my loving wife. I can’t wait for this next chapter in our adventure. Ali and Johnny get married. I love you the most.</i></p>
    <p>Back to Sara</p>
    <p><i>As we prepare for the ring exchange, I want to tell you the creation and meaning behind the rings, which have been handcrafted by the couple for this day.</i></p>
    <p><i>Many people will say that the wedding ring is a symbol of eternal love as the circle of the ring has no end or beginning. Johnny and Alison have designed and built their rings together. They would like to draw attention, not to the bands themselves, but what they stamped into them. Each ring bears the word “RESONANCE”. Not enjoying the idea of being the other half of a whole, the couple created the philosophy that each person vibrated at their own frequency. Throughout life, there are those who will compliment and those who will clash with your own. On rare occasions however, one can find another who vibrates just the same way. Their heart’s resonate with each other. In this, they amplify each other and both individuals are made more themselves by their closeness.</i></p>
    <p><i>And now we Exchange the rings, please repeat after me, as you put the ring on your partner’s finger.</i></p>
    <p><i>With this ring, we forge a new path on our adventure together. I love you, always, as my best friend.</i></p>
    <p><i>Alison and Johnny, you are now officially, as you have already been in your hearts, (Husband and Wife)</i></p>
    <p><i>We will finish the ceremony, and begin your marriage with a kiss!</i></p>
    <p><i>And now, it is with deepest pride, and greatest pleasure. That I introduce to you, Alison and Jonathon Ashen!</i></p>
