            <p><i>The first dance was eagerly anticipated and Alison has had the song picked out for years. It was only
                    slightly interrupted when not twenty seconds into it, the bustle of the dress broke! This left the
                    couple to creatively dance around the train.</i>

            <p><i>One more dance marked the day, that of Alison and her father Michael. When she was a child, Michael
                    would try to soothe her to sleep with music, however to anyone who knows him, he is not musically
                    inclined. Not knowing any nursery songs, Michael sang what he knew: classic rock. Eventually the
                    only song he sang to her was a heavily modified version of Sailing Away by Styx. Here they dance to
                    the part of the song used as her childhood lullaby. The two stop about halfway through the song as
                    that was where Michael always cut it off, unable to sing a guitar solo.</i></p>

            <h1 class="w3-center w3-text-grey"><b>The License</b></h1>
            <p><i>Due to some quirks of the Pennsylvania legal system, the bride and groom were not wed by the power of
                    a religious figure, but by their own will. Using a self-sealing marriage license designed for the
                    Quakers, Alison and Johnny pledged themselves in marriage and were witnessed by two loving friends
                    who signed as well, pledging the truth of their commitment.</i>

                    cousin, and the vegan cupcakes were from Half Dozen Bakery <a href="https://halfdozencafe.com/"

                    new machatonim, Johnny’s family. After that, Johnny’s father Dave came over for a private toast,
                    calling Alison his daughter and welcoming her to the family.</i>

            <p><i>Following dinner, the photographer and some guests left. Those who remained got comfortable: showers
                    and naps were had all around and by six that night, the family reconvened for a quiet evening of
                    doing puzzles and watching a fire burn.</i></p>
            <p><i>The morning after the ceremony was bittersweet. The whole day felt like such a blur as everyone packed
                    for their journey home.</i></p>
